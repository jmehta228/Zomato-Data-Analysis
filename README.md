# Zomato-Data-Analysis
This project involves analyzing Zomato data using Python and its key libraries. Using NumPy, we handle large-scale calculations efficiently, while Matplotlib and Seaborn allow us to create detailed, high-quality visualizations and statistical graphics. Pandas simplifies data manipulation, enabling us to load and analyze data frames effectively. This analysis was made using Jupyter Notebooks within the Visual Studio Code software. We aim to answer questions such as whether more restaurants offer online delivery versus offline services, the types of restaurants that are most popular with the public, and the price range couples prefer for dining out.
